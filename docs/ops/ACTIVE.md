## Active work

Round 24 completed the local performance, health-profile, notification, and
testing release. Android startup work moves Room and WorkManager off the first
frame, lifecycle-bounds retained collectors, and caps liquid rendering; the
same-emulator eight-launch median improved from approximately 1.465s to 1.064s.
Apple HealthKit paths now fail closed in unsigned profile-less builds. BMI,
optional user-selected target weight, aggregate vital-range status, and a
privacy-safe opt-in post-sync workout summary are implemented with
cross-platform settings schema v4. The implementation and evidence are recorded
in [Performance, health profile, and testing release](rounds/2026-08-27-performance-health-profile-release.md).

The
[NOOP Health App Store record and release preflight round](rounds/2026-08-25-noop-health-app-store-record.md)
has created the durable `NOOP Health` iOS record (`6804921246`) in `Prepare for
Submission` on exact private mainline. App Store release control is manual.
The ignored one-way launch verifier is generated locally and valid, and the
fail-closed boundary now covers the iPhone shell, iOS widgets, Live Activities,
Dynamic Island, Watch app, and Watch complications without copying verifier
material or build settings into extensions. A locked build-230 iPhone also
replaces build-229 Watch caches with a legacy-decodable neutral snapshot during
a staggered upgrade. The full embedded unsigned Release graph passes as
`9.2.0 (230)` with the existing bundle/App Group identity, 51/51 StrandDesign
tests pass, and the name-only build-setting isolation gate passes. Signed
archive, upload, physical validation, and the recorded release gates remain
open.

The final local matrix passes across the app, nine Swift packages, Android Full
and Demo flavors, StudyHarness, server, localization, privacy, legal, and
policy checks. Direct `main` publication, hosted CI, and the community testing
build are release-execution evidence for the commit containing the round
record. External signing, store, infrastructure, carrier, physical-device,
participant, and native-speaker gates remain separate.

## Decisions that remain binding

- NOOP remains local-first and account-free by default.
- Missing physiology is not zero and is never guessed.
- Wellness metrics are not medical outputs.
- Automatic medical, Rhythm, anomaly, and unvalidated fall paging remains
  disabled.
- Physical-device behavior cannot be claimed from simulator or unit evidence.
- A shared protocol or service UUID does not establish future-model support.
- BMI and target weight remain neutral, non-diagnostic user tools.
- Post-workout alerts remain generic, local, opt-in, and post-sync.
- Existing app identity and local data must be preserved during in-place
  upgrades.
- NOOP's PolyForm license and independent dependency notices remain intact.

## Next priorities after this round

1. Provision store signing and release records.
2. Deploy the production-like server topology and prove 10,000-user
   load/failover/restore behavior.
3. Complete carrier procurement and the controlled paging matrix.
4. Complete representative physical-device and in-place upgrade validation.
5. Complete held-out accuracy studies and native-speaker review.
6. Keep automatic emergency inference unavailable until its separate
   validation and regulatory program is complete.
